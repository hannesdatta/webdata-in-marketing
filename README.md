__Work in progress!__


## Dependencies
- R 
- R packages: 
	install.packages("stargazer")
- GNU make 
- For the `makefile` to work, R, Gnu make and the TeX distribution (specifically `pdflatex`) need to be made available in the system path 
- Detailed installation instructions can be found here: [tilburgsciencehub.com](httpS://tilburgsciencehub.com/)

## Notes
- `make clean` removes all unncessary temporary files.
